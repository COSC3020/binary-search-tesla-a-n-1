# Binary Search
 
Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.

I used ChatGPT to figure out why my code wasn't working and understood I made the
airhead mistake of forgetting return before calling binary search on the left and 
right sides. ChatGPT also helped me understand to use Math.floor to avoid floaters.

Ali provided help to check for duplicates and to make sure the lowest index was returned instead of any index of the desired elements.
